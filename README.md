Starting from a [simple academic computer](https://gitlab.com/jjchico-edc/yasac-public) written by Jorge Juan-Chico in Verilog, I present here my proposed solutions to the exercises of this unit of my Computer Structure course written in his made-up assembly language.

This academic computer (YASAC) has 5 stages.
In order to run the exercises corresponding to the first 2 stages, just uncomment the code you want to execute at code_mem.v.
For stages 3-5, go to code_mem and write `` `include "code/{name_of_the_file_you_want_to_execute}.code" `` before the end instruction.


You must have Icarus Verilog installed.
