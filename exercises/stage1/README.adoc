= YASAC stage 1

Initial computer design.

== Fixes

* Forgot to implemente the LDI instruction in the control unit.

== Notes

* State of the control unit is routed to the top level through signal
  state_out to test the implementation.

* The top level at system.v includes:
  - An edge detector to generate a one-cycle start pulse, so that 'start' input
    can be driven by a push button.
  - A slow 1Hz clock 'clk_in' to drive the computer, so that the operation of
    the implemented system can be easily observed.
  - A decoder for the control unit's state to light one LED at each state.
