= YASAC stage 2

Data memory and I/O.

== Fixes

* control_unit.v: Forgot next state in LDST2 (is FETCH).
* data_mem.v: Test program does not work if data mem not initialized.
  Data mem initialized to all zero.
* data_mem.v: ISE does not support memories in sensitivity list. Had to
  workaround data output multiplexing.
