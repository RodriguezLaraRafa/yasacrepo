= YASAC stage 3

Status register and branch instructions.

== Fixes

* Remove width parameter from alu (was not used).
* Put in place defalult values for new control signals (wpc, wsreg).
* Fix carry calculation in ALU. It is "result[8]^a[7]^b[7]" for both add
  and sub, but it is not very intuitive.
